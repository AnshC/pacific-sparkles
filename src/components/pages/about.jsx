                    <p className="standard-content">From a casual idea to creating something during the peak of lockdown 2020, to now selling  handcrafted organic soaps on Amazon and Flipkart, Pacific Sparkles was born  somewhere in the middle. We offer an array of aromatic and detoxifying soaps in beautiful  designs. Since our soaps are handmade, each ingredient is thoughtfully chosen to give  the best results.</p>

                            After doing our share of extensive research, we meticulously crafted a variety of  soaps and gifted them to our family and friends on Diwali 2020. The response that we received  motivated us to dream bigger and better. Pacific Sparkles is about getting closer to our  roots as each and every soap that we make is unique when it comes to the ingredients  and benefits.
